# Python Storytime

This tutorial lets you tell a story with code. It demonstrates the simple use of if/else statements to evaluate user input and generate a cute fairy story. This is a fun way to get started with Python programming that lets you really use your imagination and storytelling abilities!

Python Storytime is a Raspberry Pi Foundation project. You can complete the project using [Trinket](jumpto.cc/python-new) online or using IDLE 3 on the Raspberry Pi. It's a good first project to try out using IDLE 3 if you have already used Trinket.

Don't forget you can also complete the [Code Club Python projects](https://codeclubprojects.org/en-GB/python/) on the Raspberry Pi.
