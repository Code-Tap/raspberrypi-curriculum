# Python Turtle Snowflakes

Create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using Python Turtle. This is great fun and a great way to start learning how to code with Python. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, use loops to repeat a sequence, use the random module, and how to use functions.

Python Turtle Snowflakes is a Raspberry Pi Foundation project. You can complete the project using [Trinket](jumpto.cc/python-new) online or using IDLE 3 on the Raspberry Pi.
