title: Raspberry Pi Python Turtle Snowflakes - Volunteer Notes
---

#Introduction:

Create a beautiful landscape of snowflakes using Python Turtle. This is great fun and a great way to start learning how to code with Python. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, use loops to repeat a sequence, use the random module, and how to use functions.

#Resources
This project can be completed using Trinket or IDLE 3 on a Raspberry Pi. 

#Learning Objectives
By making snowflakes with code on your Raspberry Pi you will learn:

+ How to draw lines with Python Turtle
+ How to make turns
+ To use loops to repeat some instructions and create shapes
+ To use more loops to create spiral patterns
+ How to change the pen colour randomly
+ How to create a function to draw a snowflake

This resource covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/):

+ [Combine programming constructs to solve a problem](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/builder)
