# Python Turtley Amazing

Use Python to draw shapes, patterns, and spirals. You will use a module named Turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, and use loops to repeat a sequence. This is a great stepping stone from a visual programming language like Scratch to the text-based environment of Python.

Python Turtley Amazing is a Raspberry Pi Foundation project. You can complete the project using [Trinket](jumpto.cc/python-new) online or using IDLE 3 on the Raspberry Pi.
